## Literature survey

This literature survey is based on the paper: High Performance Cache Replacement Using Re-Reference Interval Prediction, by Aamer Jaleel, Kevin B. Theobald, Simon C. Steely Jr., and Joel Emer. The paper can be found [here](https://people.csail.mit.edu/emer/papers/2010.06.isca.rrip.pdf)

In this paper, the authors propose the SRRIP and DRRIP algorithms, which I try to explain in my presentation. Please
take a look at the [ChampSim](https://github.com/ChampSim/ChampSim) simulator, which implements these algorithms. I have
previously profiled SRRIP and DRRIP in my second assignment:

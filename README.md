# Projects for Processor Architecture course

This repo contains all my work for the VL803 course on Processor Architecture, by Prof. Nanditha Rao.

-------------------

### First assignment
Design a 7 stage pipelined OOO processor OR a Tomasulo machine, using any programming language. I am using Python over iVerilog, because I wanted to make a nice GUI. I partly get lost in the complexity of signals on GTKWave.
